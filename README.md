GeneralProgramming
================
This repository contains some programs implemented consistently 
in C++, Java, Python, and R. This is an ongoing effort to improve 
my programming skills and to become equally effective in my 
favorite programming languages.  

I do it for pure fun, whenever I find some free time.
